## User Interaction

**Search:**  Users can input a city or zip code to get weather information.<br/>
**Location-Based:** The app can automatically detect the user's location and display weather for their current area.

## API Request

The app sends a request to a weather data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) with the specified location.

## Data Retrieval

The API processes the request and fetches relevant weather data from its servers.

## Data Parsing and Formatting

The app receives the raw data from the API.
It parses the data into a usable format (e.g., JSON).
The app extracts the necessary information, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## Displaying the Information:

The app presents the formatted weather data on the user interface.<br/>

**This typically involves:**

- Displaying current weather conditions in a clear and concise manner.<br/>
- Presenting a forecast for the next few days, often in a graphical format.<br/>
- Providing additional information like UV index, air quality, and sunrise/sunset times.<br/>
